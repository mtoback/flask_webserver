# flask_webserver
flask_webserver for integration project

# Welcome!
I wrote this to give me a way to show myself and others what I can do with various technologies:
- [Angular 9](https://github.com/mtoback/angular-framework)
- REST
- Flask  (and so, python 3.7)
- Docker
- Go (to be added as a second server), and 
- PostgreSQL

The site for this is [here](http://www.iamasoftwareengineer.tech)

This is an iterative process, and a lot of it is understanding how to identify the problem. For instance, I ran into [this](https://github.com/popperjs/popper-core/issues/429) among a lot of other things.

And this, to me, is one of the biggest challege with software. Getting that "Hello World" application to play from the database to the UI, with automated deployment, testing, etc.

What you are looking at here is something that I started to conceive of on April 13, with the first iteration pushed to be pushed to Digital Ocean if all goes well later today (April 15).
